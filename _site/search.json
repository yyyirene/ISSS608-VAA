The process was divided into three main steps:\n1.1 Identify the individuals who directly influenced her.\n\n1.2 Examine the works created by Sailor Shift, and trace any indirect influences on these works from others.\n\n1.3 Apply a timeline to analyze how these influences evolved over time and observe any trends in their impact.\nSailor Shift &lt;–Person\nSailor Shift–&gt; work &lt;– Person\nSailor Shift–&gt; work_s &lt;–work_p &lt;– Person\n\n\nWho has she been most influenced by over time?\ngrViz(\"\ndigraph complex_influence {\n  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR, splines = true]\n\n  node [fontname = Helvetica, style = filled, fillcolor = \\\"white\\\", shape = box]\n  edge [style = italic, fontname = Helvetica, fontsize = 12, labeldistance = 1.2, labelloc = c, color = gray30]\n\n\n  A   [label = 'Person A']\n  B   [label = 'Person B']\n  SS  [label = 'Sailor Shift', shape = ellipse, fillcolor = \\\"#fff7c0\\\"]\n  W   [label = 'Work s']\n  W1  [label = 'Work p']\n  WO  [label = 'Work o']  \n\n  # 连线关系\n  A  -&gt; SS  [label = 'influences']\n  SS -&gt; W   [label = 'creates']\n  B  -&gt; W1  [label = 'creates']\n  W1 -&gt; W   [label = 'influences']\n  WO -&gt; SS  [label = 'influences']  \n}\n\")\n\n\n\n\nWho has she collaborated with and directly or indirectly influenced?\n\nTo address the second question, we examined both direct and indirect influences involving Sailor Shift, placing her at the center of the analysis.The process was divided into three main steps:\n2.1 Identify who she has collaborated with\nSailor Shift–&gt;work &lt;– Person\n\n\nWho has she collaborated with and directly or indirectly influenced?\ngrViz(\"\ndigraph sailor_collab {\n  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]\n\n  # 节点样式\n  node [fontname = Helvetica, style = filled, fillcolor = \\\"#ffffff\\\", shape = box,fontsize = 10, width = 0.5, height = 0.3]\n  edge [fontname = Helvetica, fontsize = 10, color = gray40]\n\n  # 节点定义\n  Sailor [label = 'Sailor Shift', shape = ellipse, fillcolor = '#fff7c0']\n  Work   [label = 'Work', shape = box, fillcolor = '#e0f7fa']\n  Person [label = 'Collaborator', shape = ellipse]\n\n  # 连线\n  Sailor -&gt; Work [label = 'co-created']\n  Person -&gt; Work [label = 'co-created']\n}\n\")\n\n\n\n2.2 Determine who she has directly or indirectly influenced\nSailor Shift–&gt;Person –&gt; work (direct)\nSailor Shift–&gt;work –&gt;Person (indirect)\n\n\nDetermine who she has directly or indirectly influenced\ngrViz(\"\ndigraph sailor_influence {\n  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]\n\n  # 节点样式\n  node [fontname = Helvetica, style = filled, fillcolor = \\\"#ffffff\\\", shape = box]\n  edge [fontname = Helvetica, fontsize = 11, labelfontsize = 11, color = gray40]\n\n  # 节点定义\n  SS  [label = 'Sailor Shift', shape = ellipse, fillcolor = '#fff7c0']\n  P1  [label = 'Person\\n(direct)']\n  W1  [label = 'Work']\n  W2  [label = 'Work\\n(indirect)']\n  P2  [label = 'Person ']\n\n  # 直接影响路径\n  SS -&gt; P1 [label = 'influences']\n  P1 -&gt; W1 [label = 'creates']\n\n  # 间接影响路径\n  SS -&gt; W2 [label = 'creates']\n  W2 -&gt; P2 [label = 'influences']\n}\n\")\n\n\n\n3.How has she influenced collaborators of the broader Oceanus Folk community?\nSailor Shift–&gt;Person/community(Oceanus Folk)–&gt;Work(Oceanus Folk)\n\n\nHow has she influenced collaborators of the broader Oceanus Folk community?\ngrViz(\"\ndigraph oceanus_influence {\n  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]\n\n  # 样式设置\n  node [fontname = Helvetica, style = filled, fillcolor = \\\"#ffffff\\\", shape = box, fontsize = 10]\n  edge [fontname = Helvetica, fontsize = 9, color = gray40]\n\n  # 节点定义\n  Sailor   [label = 'Sailor Shift', shape = ellipse, fillcolor = '#fff7c0']\n  Community [label = 'Person/Community\\\\n(Oceanus Folk)', shape = ellipse]\n  Work     [label = 'Work\\\\n(Oceanus Folk)', shape = box, fillcolor = '#e0f7fa']\n\n  # 路径连线\n  Sailor -&gt; Community [label = 'influenced']\n  Community -&gt; Work   [label = 'created']\n}\n\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIt is important to be especially careful with the direction of relationships such as “PerformerOf,” “ComposerOf,” “LyricistOf,” “ProducerOf,” as well as “DirectlySamples,” “InStyleOf,” “CoverOf,” “InterpolatesFrom,” and “LyricalReferenceTo.”\n\nSpecial attention must be paid to accurately identifying the source and target of each edge to preserve the correct semantic meaning."

This data file consists of 199,999 rows of time-series cyber attack records by country.\n\n\n\nFirst, you will use the code chunk below to import eventlog.csv file into R environment and called the data frame as attacks.\n\nattacks &lt;- read_csv(\"data/eventlog.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nIt is always a good practice to examine the imported data frame before further analysis is performed.\nFor example, kable() can be used to review the structure of the imported data frame.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\nsource_country\ntz\n\n\n\n\n2015-03-12 15:59:16\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:00:48\nFR\nEurope/Paris\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:02:26\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:02:38\nUS\nAmerica/Chicago\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:03:22\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:03:45\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three columns, namely timestamp, source_country and tz.\n\ntimestamp field stores date-time values in POSIXct format.\nsource_country field stores the source of the attack.

There are several ggplot2 extensions provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. In this section, we will learn how to create composite plot by combining multiple graphs. First, let us create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\")\n\n\n\n\nNext\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of English scores\")\np2\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we will draw a scatterplot for English score versus Maths score by as shown below\n\n\nShow the code\np3 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n             aes(x= MATHS, \n                 y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 11))\np3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ggplot2 extension’s functions support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as grid.arrange() of gridExtra package and plot_grid() of cowplot package. In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\n\nShow the code\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 + gt::gt(exam_data[1:10,  c(\"ID\", \"ENGLISH\", \"MATHS\")])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\nChange the plot to the right bottom:\n\n\nShow the code\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.5,   \n                   bottom = 0,    \n                   right = 0.98,  \n                   top = 0.3)     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatchwork R package goes nerd viral\nggrepel\nggthemes\nhrbrthemes\nggplot tips: Arranging plots\nggplot2 Theme Elements Demonstration\nggplot2 Theme Elements Reference Sheet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = GENDER, y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Boxplot of English Scores by Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = GENDER, y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_violin(fill = \"plum\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Violin Plot of English Scores by Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = GENDER, y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE, fill = \"lightcoral\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Notched Boxplot of English Scores by Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = GENDER, y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binaxis = 'y', stackdir = 'center', dotsize = 0.7) +\n  ggtitle(\"Dot Plot of English Scores by Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(ggdist)\n\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = GENDER, y = ENGLISH, fill = GENDER)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = .5, width = .6, .width = 0, justification = -.2) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .1, outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_jitter(width = .05, alpha = 0.3) +\n  ggtitle(\"Raincloud Plot: English Scores by Gender\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nexam_data &lt;- exam_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(SCORE_LEVEL = ifelse(ENGLISH &gt;= mean(ENGLISH), \"Above\", \"Below\"))\n\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = GENDER, fill = SCORE_LEVEL)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  ggtitle(\"Diverging Stacked Bar: English Score Level by Gender\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Above\" = \"skyblue\", \"Below\" = \"salmon\"))",

    "text": "Visualising distribution is not new in statistical analysis. In chapter 1 we have shared with you some of the popular statistical graphics methods for visualising distribution are histogram, probability density curve (pdf), boxplot, notch plot and violin plot and how they can be created by using ggplot2. In this chapter, we are going to share with you two relatively new statistical graphic methods for visualising distribution, namely ridgeline plot and raincloud plot by using ggplot2 and its extensions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:\n\nggridges, a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots,\nggdist, a ggplot2 extension spacially desgin for visualising distribution and uncertainty,\ntidyverse, a family of R packages to meet the modern data science and visual communication needs,\nggthemes, a ggplot extension that provides the user additional themes, scales, and geoms for the ggplots package, and\ncolorspace, an R package provides a broad toolbox for selecting individual colors or color palettes, manipulating these colors, and employing them in various kinds of visualisations.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used load these R packages into RStudio environment.\n\npacman::p_load(ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes,\n               colorspace, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, Exam_data.csv will be used.\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv into R and saved it into a tibble data.frame.\n\nexam &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, we will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package.

    "text": "Figure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

    "text": "Raincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, we will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2.

    "text": "ggdist is an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats designed especially for visualising distributions and uncertainty.\nIt is designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization:\n\nfor frequentist models, one visualises confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette(“freq-uncertainty-vis”));\nfor Bayesian models, one visualises probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, stat_pointinterval() of ggdist is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.\n\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, \n             y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_pointinterval() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis function comes with many arguments, students are advised to read the syntax reference for more detail.\n\n\nFor example, in the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\n.width = 0.95\n.point = median\n.interval = qi\n\n\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_pointinterval(.width = 0.95,\n  .point = median,\n  .interval = qi) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of median math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Median Point + Multiple-interval plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#95%-99%\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_pointinterval(\n    .width =c(0.95, 0.99),   \n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising 95% and 99% Confidence Intervals of Mean Math Score\",\n    subtitle = \"Mean Point + Multiple-Interval Plot\",\n    x = \"Race\",\n    y = \"Math Score\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#95%\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, \n             y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_pointinterval(\n    show.legend = FALSE) +   \n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, stat_gradientinterval() of ggdist is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.\n\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, \n             y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_gradientinterval(   \n    fill = \"skyblue\",      \n    show.legend = TRUE     \n  ) +                        \n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Gradient + interval plot\")",

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, we will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, we will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\ngapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org.

It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).\nease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic.

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, we will learn how to create interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by ggiraph and plotlyr packages.\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:\n\nggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\nDT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\npatchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.\n\npacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, ggplot2,\n               patchwork,DT, tidyverse) \n\n\n\n\nIn this section, Exam_data.csv provided will be used. Using read_csv() of readr package, import Exam_data.csv into R.\nThe code chunk below read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called exam_data.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\",show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides.\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\n\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css &lt;- \"background-color:red; #&lt;&lt;\nfont-style:bold; color:white;\" #&lt;&lt;\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(    #&lt;&lt;\n    opts_tooltip(    #&lt;&lt;\n      css = tooltip_css)) #&lt;&lt;\n)                                        \n\nNotice that the background colour of the tooltip is red and the font colour is white and bold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.Change the color of tooltip_css(use_fill = TRUE)\n2.Add the Hover Interaction to (primary = “yellow”, secondary = “red”)\n3.Set tooltip will be fixed(argument use_cursor_pos is set to FALSE )\n4.Activate zoom\n\n\nShow the code\ntooltip_css &lt;- \"background-color:black; \nfont-style:bold; color:white;\"\n\ncss_default_hover &lt;- girafe_css_bicolor(primary = \"yellow\", secondary = \"red\")\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS , fill = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID,data_id = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 0.5, \n    dotsize = 3,\n    method = \"histodot\",\n    color = NA) +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  xlim(min(exam_data$MATHS) - 1, max(exam_data$MATHS) + 1)\n  \ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p + scale_color_viridis_c() ,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(\n  opts_hover(css = css_default_hover),\n  opts_tooltip(\n  use_fill = TRUE,\n  offx = 50,\n  offy = 50, \n  use_cursor_pos = FALSE),\n  opts_zoom(min = 1, max = 4),\n  opts_sizing(rescale = TRUE),\n  opts_toolbar(saveaspng = FALSE, position = \"bottom\", delay_mouseout = 5000)\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo enable hover interaction, we need to include a data_id mapping in geom_dotplot_interactive().\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.\n\ntooltip &lt;- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {\n  mean &lt;- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  sem &lt;- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  paste(\"Mean maths scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem)\n}\n\ngg_point &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n                   aes(x = RACE),\n) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS, \n                   tooltip = after_stat(  \n                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  \n    fun.data = \"mean_se\", \n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,  \n    fill = \"light blue\"\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS),\n    fun.data = mean_se,\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, linewidth = 0.2\n\n  )\n\ngirafe(ggobj = gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below shows the second interactive feature of ggiraph, namely data_id.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(           \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),             \n    stackgroups = TRUE,               \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618                      \n)                                        \n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(           \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),             \n    stackgroups = TRUE,               \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618                      \n)                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe reason that a large orange highlight when interacting is because data_id = CLASS will bind all students in the same class into the same interaction group\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, css codes are used to change the highlighting effect.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Different from previous example, in this example the ccs customisation request are encoded directly.\n\n\n\nThere are time that we want to combine tooltip and hover effect on the interactive statistical graph as shown in the code chunk below.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = CLASS, \n        data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.

It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).\n\n\n\nA wrapper of the JavaScript Library DataTables\nData objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library ‘DataTables’ (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).\n\n\nDT::datatable(exam_data, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below is used to implement the coordinated brushing shown above.\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data) \np &lt;- ggplot(d, \n            aes(ENGLISH, \n                MATHS)) + \n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg &lt;- highlight(ggplotly(p),        \n                \"plotly_selected\")  \n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,               \n                  DT::datatable(d), \n                  widths = 5)        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis link provides online version of the reference guide and several useful articles.

It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\n\n\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\n\n\nIn the above the .N() function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly .E() will give you the edge data and .G() will give you the tbl_graph object itself.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we will use tbl_graph() of tinygraph package to build an tidygraph’s network graph data.frame.\nBefore typing the codes, we are recommended to review to reference guide of tbl_graph()\n\nGAStech_graph &lt;- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nGAStech_graph\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4 (active)\n      id label               Department     Title                               \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                               \n 1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                    \n 2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                    \n 3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                    \n 4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                    \n 5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Mana…\n 6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager       \n 7     7 Cornelia.Lais       Administration Assistant to Security Group Manager \n 8    44 Kanon.Herrero       Security       Badging Office                      \n 9    45 Varja.Lagos         Security       Badging Office                      \n10    46 Stenig.Fusil        Security       Building Control                    \n# ℹ 44 more rows\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     2 Sunday       5\n2     1     2 Monday       2\n3     1     2 Tuesday      3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges.\nThe command also prints the first six rows of “Node Data” and the first three of “Edge Data”.\nIt states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n\n\n\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use activate() and then arrange().\n\nGAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  activate(edges) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4 (active)\n    from    to Weekday   Weight\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n 1    40    41 Saturday      13\n 2    41    43 Monday        11\n 3    35    31 Tuesday       10\n 4    40    41 Monday        10\n 5    40    43 Monday        10\n 6    36    32 Sunday         9\n 7    40    43 Saturday       9\n 8    41    40 Monday         9\n 9    19    15 Wednesday      8\n10    35    38 Tuesday        8\n# ℹ 1,362 more rows\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4\n     id label           Department     Title           \n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;           \n1     1 Mat.Bramar      Administration Assistant to CEO\n2     2 Anda.Ribera     Administration Assistant to CFO\n3     3 Rachel.Pantanal Administration Assistant to CIO\n# ℹ 51 more rows\n\n\nVisit the reference guide of activate() to find out more about the function.\n\n\n\n\nggraph is an extension of ggplot2, making it easier to carry over basic ggplot skills to the design of network graphs.\nAs in all network graph, there are three main aspects to a ggraph’s network graph, they are:\n\nnodes,\nedges and\nlayouts.\n\nFor a comprehensive discussion of each of this aspect of graph, please refer to their respective vignettes provided.\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses ggraph(), geom-edge_link() and geom_node_point() to plot a network graph by using GAStech_graph. Before your get started, it is advisable to read their respective reference guide at least once.\n\nggraph(GAStech_graph) +\n  geom_edge_link() +\n  geom_node_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nThe basic plotting function is ggraph(), which takes the data to be used for the graph and the type of layout desired. Both of the arguments for ggraph() are built around igraph. Therefore, ggraph() can use either an igraph object or a tbl_graph object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use theme_graph() to remove the x and y axes. Before your get started, it is advisable to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nggraph introduces a special ggplot theme that provides better defaults for network graphs than the normal ggplot defaults. theme_graph(), besides removing axes, grids, and border, changes the font to Arial Narrow (this can be overridden).\nThe ggraph theme can be set for a series of plots with the set_graph_style() command run before the graphs are plotted or by using theme_graph() in the individual plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, theme_graph() makes it easy to change the coloring of the plot.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))\n\ng + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',\n                text_colour = 'white')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggraph support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl. Figures below and on the right show layouts supported by ggraph().\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below will be used to plot the network graph using Fruchterman and Reingold layout.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nlayout argument is used to define the layout to be used.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will colour each node by referring to their respective departments.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, \n                      size = 3))\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunks above:\n\ngeom_node_point is equivalent in functionality to geo_point of ggplot2. It allows for simple plotting of nodes in different shapes, colours and sizes. In the codes chnuks above colour and size are used.\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the thickness of the edges will be mapped with the Weight variable.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 3)\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunks above:\n\ngeom_edge_link draws edges in the simplest way - as straight lines between the start and end nodes. But, it can do more that that. In the example above, argument width is used to map the width of the line in proportional to the Weight attribute and argument alpha is used to introduce opacity on the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother very useful feature of ggraph is faceting. In visualising network data, this technique can be used to reduce edge over-plotting in a very meaning way by spreading nodes and edges out based on their attributes. In this section, you will learn how to use faceting technique to visualise network data.\nThere are three functions in ggraph to implement faceting, they are:\n\nfacet_nodes() whereby edges are only draw in a panel if both terminal nodes are present here,\nfacet_edges() whereby nodes are always drawn in al panels even if the node data contains an attribute named the same as the one used for the edge facetting, and\nfacet_graph() faceting on two variables simultaneously.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, facet_edges() is used. Before getting started, it is advisable for you to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n\ng + facet_edges(~Weekday)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n  \ng + facet_edges(~Weekday)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset_graph_style() \n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n  \ng + facet_edges(~Weekday) +\n  th_foreground(foreground = \"grey80\",  \n                border = TRUE) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n  \ng + facet_nodes(~Department)+\n  th_foreground(foreground = \"grey80\",  \n                border = TRUE) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntidygraph package inherits many of the community detection algorithms imbedded into igraph and makes them available to us, including Edge-betweenness (group_edge_betweenness), Leading eigenvector (group_leading_eigen), Fast-greedy (group_fast_greedy), Louvain (group_louvain), Walktrap (group_walktrap), Label propagation (group_label_prop), InfoMAP (group_infomap), Spinglass (group_spinglass), and Optimal (group_optimal).

    "text": "In this section, we will learn how to create a graph data model by using tidygraph package. It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\n\n\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\n\n\nIn the above the .N() function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data.

    "text": "ggraph is an extension of ggplot2, making it easier to carry over basic ggplot skills to the design of network graphs.\nAs in all network graph, there are three main aspects to a ggraph’s network graph, they are:\n\nnodes,\nedges and\nlayouts.\n\nFor a comprehensive discussion of each of this aspect of graph, please refer to their respective vignettes provided.\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses ggraph(), geom-edge_link() and geom_node_point() to plot a network graph by using GAStech_graph. Before your get started, it is advisable to read their respective reference guide at least once.\n\nggraph(GAStech_graph) +\n  geom_edge_link() +\n  geom_node_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nThe basic plotting function is ggraph(), which takes the data to be used for the graph and the type of layout desired. Both of the arguments for ggraph() are built around igraph. Therefore, ggraph() can use either an igraph object or a tbl_graph object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use theme_graph() to remove the x and y axes. Before your get started, it is advisable to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nggraph introduces a special ggplot theme that provides better defaults for network graphs than the normal ggplot defaults. theme_graph(), besides removing axes, grids, and border, changes the font to Arial Narrow (this can be overridden).\nThe ggraph theme can be set for a series of plots with the set_graph_style() command run before the graphs are plotted or by using theme_graph() in the individual plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, theme_graph() makes it easy to change the coloring of the plot.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))\n\ng + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',\n                text_colour = 'white')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggraph support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl. Figures below and on the right show layouts supported by ggraph().\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below will be used to plot the network graph using Fruchterman and Reingold layout.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nlayout argument is used to define the layout to be used.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will colour each node by referring to their respective departments.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, \n                      size = 3))\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunks above:\n\ngeom_node_point is equivalent in functionality to geo_point of ggplot2. It allows for simple plotting of nodes in different shapes, colours and sizes. In the codes chnuks above colour and size are used.\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the thickness of the edges will be mapped with the Weight variable.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 3)\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunks above:\n\ngeom_edge_link draws edges in the simplest way - as straight lines between the start and end nodes. But, it can do more that that. In the example above, argument width is used to map the width of the line in proportional to the Weight attribute and argument alpha is used to introduce opacity on the line.",

Examples include:\n\ngeom_point for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)\ngeom_smooth for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)\ngeom_bar for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts)\ngeom_histogram for drawing binned values (e.g. a histogram)\ngeom_polygon for drawing arbitrary shapes\ngeom_map for drawing polygons in the shape of a map! (You can access the data to use for these maps by using the map_data() function).\n\nA plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the + operator.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots a bar chart by using geom_bar().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)\n\nBin width defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data. Pick better value with\n`binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: Be warned The y scale is not very useful, in fact it is very misleading. :::\n\nThe code chunk below performs the following two steps:\n\nscale_y_continuous() is used to turn off the y-axis, and\nbinwidth argument is used to change the binwidth to 2.5.\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram()       \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the default bin is 30.\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\nbins argument is used to change the number of bins to 20,\nfill argument is used to shade the histogram with light blue color, and\ncolor argument is used to change the outline colour of the bars in black\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20,            \n                 color=\"black\",      \n                 fill=\"light blue\")  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"grey30\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis approach can be used to colour, fill and alpha of the geometric.\n\n1.7.6 Geometric Objects: geom-density()\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density()           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           colour = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS,       \n           x= GENDER)) +    \n  geom_boxplot()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotches are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)",

Influence\n\nSailor Shift’s compositions were inspired by a wide temporal range of influencer works from the 1980s to the 2020s.\nNotable classics that shaped her music include:\nReflejo Interior (1983, Americana) → Influenced Electric Reverie\nTwilight’s Threshold (2007, Synthwave) → Influenced Tides of Echos\nHallowed Transaction (2017, Doom Metal) and Divergent Memories (2017, Indie Folk) → Contributed to her emerging Indie and Metal sounds\nFrom a genre perspective, Sailor draws from Synthwave, Doom Metal, Dream Pop, Indie Rock, and Psychedelic Rock, blending them into her distinctive Oceanus Folk style.\n\nTime Distribution & Creative Rhythm\n\n2015–2020 marks the starting phase of stylistic absorption.\n\nSongs like Melancholy Circuitry and Stormsong show early influence connections — indicating the onset of external musical borrowing.\n2023–2035 is her most active creative and stylistic integration period.\n\nThe visualization shows a dense cluster of red points (Sailor’s works) and blue points (influencer works), suggesting heavy external inspiration and high creative output during this time.\n\nCreative Maturity vs. Density of Inspiration\n\nSongs such as:\nTidesworn Ballads, Coral Beats, Driftwood Lullaby, Electric Reverie\n\nare influenced by multiple sources — identifying them as “convergent inspiration” pieces reflecting diverse stylistic integration.\nData also reveals:\nMost of Sailor’s songs are of the Oceanus Folk genre, while the influencers span Synthwave, Southern Gothic, Indie Pop, Symphonic Metal, and more.\nHer most notable works (marked as Notable = TRUE) tend to be those that were heavily influenced — indicating that inspiration led to impact.\n\n\n\nWe analyze the ‘Person → Work’ connections that contribute to the

illustrates that Sailor Shift is not an isolated creator, but rather a convergence point within a multi-layered web of artistic influence.\nShe is directly influenced by several notable works, such as Tides of Echos and Electric Reverie, which themselves are shaped by earlier compositions and artists.\nAmong the sources of influence, four musical groups play a key role, including her own band Ivy Echos. The remaining groups—such as The Saltwater Weavers, The Fiddle & the Fjord, and The Salty Wakes—are projects she was closely involved in, either as a producer or performer. This dual role highlights her position as both an influencer and a participant in collaborative creation.\nIn the third layer of the influence network, most of the connections are formed through InStyleOf and InterpolatesFrom edges, indicating that Sailor Shift primarily draws inspiration from the style and structural elements of earlier works. Only a few edges fall under CoverOf, suggesting that her creative process leans more toward reinterpretation and transformation rather than direct replication.\nThis cascading network of style, melody, and lyrical influence reflects not only her artistic lineage, but also reveals the broader creative transmission ecosystem within the Oceanus Folk community.\n\n\n\n\n2.Who has she collaborated with and directly or indirectly influenced? &\n\n\n3.How has she influenced collaborators of the broader Oceanus Folk community\nFirst we will first answer ：Who has she influenced ?\nAnd here is the directly neighbours :\n\nnodes_tbl &lt;- nodes_tbl %&gt;% mutate(index = row_number())\n\nsailor_index &lt;- nodes_tbl %&gt;%\n  filter(name == \"Sailor Shift\") %&gt;%\n  pull(index)\n\ninfluence_edges &lt;- c(\"InStyleOf\", \"CoverOf\", \"InterpolatesFrom\", \"LyricalReferenceTo\", \"DirectlySamples\")\n\nedges_from_sailor &lt;- edges_tbl %&gt;%\n  filter(to == sailor_index & `Edge Type` %in% influence_edges)\n\ninfluenced1 &lt;- edges_from_sailor %&gt;%\n  left_join(nodes_tbl, by = c(\"from\" = \"index\")) %&gt;%\n  select(name, `Edge Type`, everything())\n\n\nknitr::kable(head(influenced1, 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nEdge Type\nsource\ntarget\nkey\nfrom\nto\nNode Type\nsingle\nrelease_date\ngenre\nnotable\nid\nwritten_date\nstage_name\nnotoriety_date\n\n\n\n\nCassette Future\nInStyleOf\n17022\n17255\n0\n17023\n17256\nMusicalGroup\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n17022\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nSilver Veil\nLyricalReferenceTo\n17032\n17255\n0\n17033\n17256\nMusicalGroup\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n17032\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nThe Phantom Operators\nInterpolatesFrom\n17063\n17255\n0\n17064\n17256\nMusicalGroup\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n17063\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nThe Hollow Monarchs\nInStyleOf\n17110\n17255\n0\n17111\n17256\nMusicalGroup\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n17110\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nCassian Storm\nLyricalReferenceTo\n17126\n17255\n0\n17127\n17256\nPerson\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n17126\nNA\nSeraphina Vale\nNA\n\n\nClaire Holmes\nInterpolatesFrom\n17155\n17255\n0\n17156\n17256\nPerson\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n17155\nNA\nJaye Finch\nNA\n\n\nCopper Canyon Ghosts\nDirectlySamples\n17361\n17255\n0\n17362\n17256\nMusicalGroup\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n17361\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubgraph_in &lt;- extract_subnetwork(\n  graph, \n  node_name = \"Sailor Shift\", \n  distance = 3, \n  direction = \"in\"\n)\n\nedges_vn &lt;- igraph::as_data_frame(subgraph_in, what = \"edges\") %&gt;%\n  filter(`Edge Type` != \"ProducerOf\") %&gt;%\n  rename(from = from, to = to, label = `Edge Type`)\n\nnodes_vn &lt;- igraph::as_data_frame(subgraph_in, what = \"vertices\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(id = name, label = name, group = `Node Type`)\n\nused_nodes &lt;- unique(c(edges_vn$from, edges_vn$to))\nnodes_vn &lt;- nodes_vn %&gt;% filter(id %in% used_nodes)\n\nvisNetwork(nodes_vn, edges_vn, height = \"800px\", width = \"100%\") %&gt;%\n  visEdges(arrows = \"to\") %&gt;%\n  visOptions(\n    highlightNearest = list(enabled = TRUE, degree = 3, hover = TRUE),\n    nodesIdSelection = TRUE,\n    selectedBy = \"group\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  visLegend() %&gt;%\n  visLayout(randomSeed = 1234) %&gt;%\n  visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho has she influenced directly or indirectly？\n\n\n\nThese are edges originating from Sailor Shift, indicating how she influences other groups or works:\n\nInStyleOf: stylistic influence or similar musical style\nInterpolatesFrom: portions of her work have been interpolated\nLyricalReferenceTo: her name or lyrics are referenced\nDirectlySamples: her work has been directly sampled\n\nSailor Shift has a broad creative influence\n\nShe influences at least 5 different groups (e.g., Cassette Future, The Hollow Monarchs)\nThe types of influence span style, lyrics, and sampling.\n\nAn indirect “sub-network” is formed\n\nFor example, through the path Sailor Shift → Cassette Future → Zara Quinn, her influence extends to band members as well.\n\nStrong structural centrality\n\nSailor Shift is the hub of this network, with nearly all edges revolving around her.\nThis suggests she holds a central position of influence in this music community.\n\n\n\nWe attempted to trace Sailor Shift’s indirect influence through songs and albums to identify impacted individuals. However, this approach yielded no results, so we decided not to pursue this path further.\nBased on the results, Copper Canyon Ghosts is identified as an Oceanus Folk band.

It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us call the ggplot() function using the code chunk on the right.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nA blank canvas appears.\nggplot() initializes a ggplot object.\nThe data argument defines the dataset to be used for plotting.\nIf the dataset is not already a data.frame, it will be converted to one by fortify()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nggplot includes the x-axis and the axis’s label.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include:\n\ngeom_point for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)\ngeom_smooth for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)\ngeom_bar for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts)\ngeom_histogram for drawing binned values (e.g. a histogram)\ngeom_polygon for drawing arbitrary shapes\ngeom_map for drawing polygons in the shape of a map! (You can access the data to use for these maps by using the map_data() function).\n\nA plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the + operator.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots a bar chart by using geom_bar().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)\n\nBin width defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data. Pick better value with\n`binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: Be warned The y scale is not very useful, in fact it is very misleading. :::\n\nThe code chunk below performs the following two steps:\n\nscale_y_continuous() is used to turn off the y-axis, and\nbinwidth argument is used to change the binwidth to 2.5.\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram()       \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the default bin is 30.\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\nbins argument is used to change the number of bins to 20,\nfill argument is used to shade the histogram with light blue color, and\ncolor argument is used to change the outline colour of the bars in black\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20,            \n                 color=\"black\",      \n                 fill=\"light blue\")  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"grey30\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis approach can be used to colour, fill and alpha of the geometric.\n\n1.7.6 Geometric Objects: geom-density()\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density()           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           colour = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS,       \n           x= GENDER)) +    \n  geom_boxplot()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotches are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun = \"mean\",         \n               colour =\"red\",        \n               size=4)               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_point(stat=\"summary\",        \n             fun=\"mean\",           \n             colour=\"red\",          \n             size=4)          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(size=0.5)\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default method used is loess.\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              linewidth=0.5)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_grid(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_gray()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadley Wickham (2023) ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, we will learn how to create interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by ggiraph and plotlyr packages.\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:\n\nggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\nDT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\npatchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.\n\npacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, ggplot2,\n               patchwork,DT, tidyverse) \n\n\n\n\nIn this section, Exam_data.csv provided will be used. Using read_csv() of readr package, import Exam_data.csv into R.\nThe code chunk below read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called exam_data.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\",show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides.\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph.

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, we will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, we will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering.

It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).\nease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic.

There are several ggplot2 extensions provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. In this section, we will learn how to create composite plot by combining multiple graphs. First, let us create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\")\n\n\n\n\nNext\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of English scores\")\np2\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we will draw a scatterplot for English score versus Maths score by as shown below\n\n\nShow the code\np3 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n             aes(x= MATHS, \n                 y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 11))\np3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ggplot2 extension’s functions support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as grid.arrange() of gridExtra package and plot_grid() of cowplot package. In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\n\nShow the code\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 + gt::gt(exam_data[1:10,  c(\"ID\", \"ENGLISH\", \"MATHS\")])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\nChange the plot to the right bottom:\n\n\nShow the code\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.5,   \n                   bottom = 0,    \n                   right = 0.98,  \n                   top = 0.3)     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatchwork R package goes nerd viral\nggrepel\nggthemes\nhrbrthemes\nggplot tips: Arranging plots\nggplot2 Theme Elements Demonstration\nggplot2 Theme Elements Reference Sheet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = GENDER, y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Boxplot of English Scores by Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = GENDER, y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_violin(fill = \"plum\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Violin Plot of English Scores by Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = GENDER, y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE, fill = \"lightcoral\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Notched Boxplot of English Scores by Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = GENDER, y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binaxis = 'y', stackdir = 'center', dotsize = 0.7) +\n  ggtitle(\"Dot Plot of English Scores by Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(ggdist)\n\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = GENDER, y = ENGLISH, fill = GENDER)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = .5, width = .6, .width = 0, justification = -.2) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .1, outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_jitter(width = .05, alpha = 0.3) +\n  ggtitle(\"Raincloud Plot: English Scores by Gender\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nexam_data &lt;- exam_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(SCORE_LEVEL = ifelse(ENGLISH &gt;= mean(ENGLISH), \"Above\", \"Below\"))\n\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = GENDER, fill = SCORE_LEVEL)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  ggtitle(\"Diverging Stacked Bar: English Score Level by Gender\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Above\" = \"skyblue\", \"Below\" = \"salmon\"))",

In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\n\nShow the code\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3",
